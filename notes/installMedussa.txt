Problem: cannot find numpy

	- when running setup.py build, can find numpy, but when running sudo setup.py install, 		it cannot find

solution: 
	not a problem of setup.py, problem of sudo!!



why sudo install is different from install?


when running code, another error:

	OSError: libportaudio.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
